1. What is Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP)?
EECP is a non-invasive treatment designed to improve blood flow to the heart. It involves the use of inflatable cuffs wrapped around the legs, which inflate and deflate in sync with your heartbeat to enhance circulation and reduce chest pain caused by angina. It is an FDA-approved therapy often used for patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure who are not candidates for surgery.

2. Who is a good candidate for EECP treatment?
EECP is ideal for patients who:

Have persistent chest pain (angina) despite medications.
Are not suitable for invasive procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery.
Prefer a non-invasive approach to improve heart health.
It is important to consult with your doctor to determine if EECP is the right option for you.
3. How does EECP therapy work?
During EECP, inflatable cuffs are placed on your calves, thighs, and buttocks. These cuffs inflate during the relaxation phase of your heartbeat and deflate just before your heart pumps blood. This synchronized inflation and deflation help:

Improve blood flow to the heart.
Reduce the workload on the heart.
Promote the development of new blood vessels (collateral circulation).
4. Are there any side effects or risks associated with EECP?
EECP is generally considered safe and well-tolerated. Common side effects include:

Mild skin irritation or bruising on the legs from the cuffs.
Fatigue during the first few sessions.
However, it is not recommended for patients with severe high blood pressure, arrhythmias, or active blood clots. Your doctor will evaluate your medical history before starting treatment.
